      "Members of Uganda Tourism recently met with members with the U.S.-based International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association, according to the British website SoSoGay. The meeting was arranged by the Africa Travel Association and took place during an American travel convention. IGLTA president John Tanzella is quoted by SoSoGay as saying, \"The delegation said that gay people are welcome. They were very concerned about the perception of Uganda in Western Europe and North America, and claimed that the backlash caught them by surprise. No one thought it would pass. The delegates all pointed out that they have friends and family who are gay.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Uganda passed an \"anti-homosexuality\" law in February that would have sent some gay people to prison for life; an earlier version condemned some to death. The legislation even included punishments for heterosexual people who help LGBT people.The law was overturned in court this summer, but extreme antigay animus remains in the east African nation, fanned by homophobic politicians and tabloids that promote violence against LGBTs. Kidnappings persist and many live in constant fear. One of the nation's most prominent gay activists, David Kato, was murdered in 2011.\n",

      "\n",
      "CONTINUATION:\n",
      " And then she went on to do what she condemned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexual harassment occurs when one person chooses to sexually objectify another person. And in a tweet, DeGeneres shared a photo of herself and singer Katy Perry with DeGeneres’ jaw wide open and gawking directly at Perry's breasts. To complete the hypocritical gesture, DeGeneres included this caption:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The real question now is how would DeGeneres have responded if it were a man who did exactly what she did – taking a photo posing with his jaw wide open and head gawking into the breasts of another woman?\n",
      "\n",
      "How would DeGeneres react if it were a man making the same comments, calling a woman’s breasts “big balloons?” She would no doubt be one of the first people to publicly condemn such an action as being sexist and harassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not a male thing or a female thing, it is not a Hollywood thing or a political thing, this is a human thing and it happens in the workplace, it happens in families, it happens all over the world and we are all the same,” she said on her TV show in a monologue discussing sexual harassment. “We all want the same thing, we want respect, love and kindness. And if I could have those three things and an iPhone X, I would be complete.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So how does DeGeneres justify her sexist action?\n",

      " David Lynch’s art pivots on an urge to both objectify and empathize with women, which nests in a love for America that’s itself complicated by an awareness of the country’s foundation of patriarchal rot. \n",
      "\n",
      "CONTINUATION:\n",
      " Lynch is drunk on archetypes, on the pure and lovely blond damsel in distress and on the dark brunette who can teach a young man the politics of sex. And he’s also drunk on the iconography of coffee, diners, neon signs, hunting, trees, and small-town banter—as well as murder-mystery conventions and the cultural aftereffects of starlets who’ve been eaten alive by the Hollywood machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) haunts Twin Peaks as an embodiment of the price that women pay for male fantasy. She’s enmeshed with seemingly every man in the town of Twin Peaks, but none of them know or want her. They yearn for the all-American homecoming queen and the sex kitten we know from too much media. They lust after the uncomplicated and smiling girl that the iconic framed picture of Laura, ready for the dance, promises. The men of this fictional Washington town want a girl who looks soft, affirming their superficial and sentimental ideas of courtly love, and who fucks like a porn star. In the original two-season run of Twin Peaks, we never learned who Laura was, as she was a MacGuffin, a device for offering a tour of societal neuroses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, Lynch reveals Laura to the audience, following her over the last week of her life. And her story’s even uglier than one might’ve presumed of someone who once occupied a show as a slain lamb. Like every other female protagonist in a Lynch film, Laura’s torn between honoring the rules of a male-driven society and satisfying an unknown element of herself. Laura sometimes enjoys her role as a sex goddess, reveling in the agency such a status accords, but this assignation is shown by Lynch to be a trap as well as an instrument of survival that was forced on her at a young age. Every man wants something from Laura, pawing and pestering her, draining her of a private essence. Life as Laura Palmer is exhausting, as even a tedious sap like James (James Marshall) seeks to possess her and define her by his own notions of how a woman should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lynch undermines pleasing American iconography with perverse narrative detours or elaborate tableaux of pain; the filmmaker reveals the bugs living underneath, say, the greenest of lawns. And this is why audiences resent him, and why films such as Fire Walk with Me take time to earn their reputation. Like Twin Peaks: The Return, the film often elides the coffee, donuts, and talk of cherry pie that are fondly associated with the original series. Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), an unusually sympathetic Lynch male who’s also eaten up with ideas of female status, is largely absent from Fire Walk with Me, and his few scenes show him to be an impotent hero who has visions of Laura’s demise that are too muddy to prevent her death.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point, Dale has a vision of being visible from a security camera while simultaneously watching himself from a control room—a split that echoes the two Dales of Twin Peaks and anticipates the many Dales of The Return, while also forming the sort of temporal loop that governs Lynch’s work. Dale’s lost, unable to revolutionize a patriarchy that he, via the F.B.I., actually affirms. He’s bound to wind up like Special Agent Phillip Jeffries (David Bowie), who’s also split into multiple versions of himself and swallowed up by the social evil that’s symbolized by an electrically charged alternate dimension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale’s premonitions compose one of Fire Walk with Me’s many temporal loops. But the film’s primary loop involves Laura’s destiny to be murdered by her father, Leland (Ray Wise), who’s controlled by BOB (Frank Silva), a demon from the other dimension. Leland rapes and kills his daughter out of a fealty to the American male urge, succumbing to the sickness that drives men to destroy women while rationalizing themselves as the victims. Laura seals her doom when she awakens and sees her rapist not as BOB, but as Leland, setting in motion events that will recur throughout the Twin Peaks universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film’s set pieces—like the dinner scene in which Leland’s possession of Laura is equated to his revulsion with her fingernails—anticipate a fissure in a reality/fantasy continuum. Laura’s in danger of waking up from her drug- and sex-addled stupor of denial, and so she must die to restore order to Twin Peaks and male America at large. One of Fire Walk with Me’s final images involves old men feasting on Laura’s misery, which is symbolized by an insane and absurdist Lynchian flourish: creamed corn, a staple of Americana.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Twin Peaks and The Return, Fire Walk with Me isn’t as uncomplicatedly feminist as it may sound. Lynch is disgusted by Laura’s sexualizing, though he sexualizes her. In Lynch’s cinema, one impulse doesn’t simply render the other hypocritical. An artist, regardless of political mores, must honor their insanity and contradiction. Laura’s body is often lingered on in stages of undress. These images are erotic, but they’re also intentionally framed in a manner that emphasizes their own leering sense of contrivance. When Laura is about to have sex with James at their high school, ludicrously clad in only a bath towel, the camera pans to highlight her breasts. The camera’s movement is a violation that undercuts the spell of the naïvely purplish dialogue, as if Lynch is saying “you can’t catch this on television.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Lynch also truly sees Laura in her profound loneliness and helplessness, filming her face in rapturous close-ups that physicalize a fragility with which the characters refuse to reckon. In a staggering performance, Lee plays Laura’s entrapment with an operatic and heartbreaking kind of wide-eyed musicality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laura’s descent into hell is foreshadowed by many harbingers of doom, especially Fire Walk with Me’s Pink Room sequence, a riotous explosion of lurid color, accompanied by music that suggests a sexually frenzied funeral dirge. Angelo Badalamenti’s sonorous horns accompany images that’re dotted with youthful female nudity that’s uncomfortably and poignantly sleazy. At this point, we couldn’t be farther away from the romanticism of Twin Peaks at its sweetest. When Laura sits at a booth topless, entertaining piggish men, even the horniest audiences should feel her exploitation and vulnerability. When Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine) sees Laura, the horns of the soundtrack underline the inevitability of tragedy. Viewers of Twin Peaks know Ronette as one of the last people to see Laura alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laura’s death scene is framed as a brutal act of release. Lynch splinters the murder into religious shards of blood, strobe light and smeared makeup, as Leland pummels Laura, sending her to the Black Lodge as a resigned and benign prisoner who will observe Twin Peak’s continuing evil from a theoretically safe distance. An angel by her side, Laura may finally know peace. Though even this qualified settlement, representative of a life a woman might be able to carve out for herself in a male universe, is disrupted by a man 25 years later. And Laura senses this intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second-season finale of Twin Peaks, Laura told Dale in the Black Lodge that they weren’t done. In The Return, Dale can’t accept his limitations, as he has his own version of Laura, the eternally rescuable victim, to guard. Dale’s actions may or may not lead to the obliteration of Twin Peaks, which may or may not be a happy ending—a casting out of the mythology that America uses to paper over its legacy of atrocity. Fire Walk with Me is also an act of exorcism, as Lynch turns a MacGuffin into a human casualty, plumbing the recesses of his id and art to create one of his greatest films.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image/Sound\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been watching Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me for 25 years, primarily on beat-up VHS tapes and DVDs, and it’s never looked as beautiful as it does on Criterion’s 4K restoration, which was overseen by David Lynch. (Full disclosure: I haven’t seen the film’s presentation on Twin Peaks: The Entire Mystery.) While I had a suspicion of what I was missing, I had no clue that the film was even supposed to look this beautiful. The colors that Lynch so often favors in his filmography—rose red, blue-velvet blue, auburn, and deep black—look as lush here as they do in any other Lynch film. Image texture is also now extravagantly detailed from the ridiculous woodwork of a redneck sheriff’s office to the sensual and heartbreaking skin tones of Laura Palmer and Ronette Pulaski. And Laura’s eyes have never been so vivid, so pristine and bottomless. Two soundtracks have been included, and, if you have the speakers, the 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround is a knock out that suggests an immersive concerto in hell, particularly in the Pink Room sequence, which resounds with intricate horns, distortions, and other bass-rich nuances. The 2.0 mix might be better for purists and those with a less intricate sound system, and also boasts a superb soundstage that honors every minute detail of Lynch and composer Angelo Badalamenti’s aural universe.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Criterion’s inclusion of “The Missing Pieces” is good news for those who already owned a box set of Twin Peaks and weren’t ready to double dip with Twin Peaks: The Entire Mystery, where this material originally surfaced in 2014. “The Missing Pieces” amounts to more than simply 90 minutes of extended and deleted scenes from Fire Walk with Me, as Lynch supervised the editing of this supplement himself, sculpting it into a modal sketchbook that’s pure Lynch straight from the tap. There’s quite a bit more footage of the original Twin Peaks cast, further underlining the town’s willed obliviousness to Laura’s misery, and, though strong, this material might’ve diluted Fire Walk with Me‘s relentlessly singular focus. There’s also an unmooring scene with Phillip Jeffries that should’ve found its way into the film’s final cut, and more about the demonic caste system of the Black Lodge, including references to a convenience-store hideout that would eventually be used for Twin Peaks: The Return. This featurette-as-alternate-film is a must for Lynch acolytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2014 interview between Lynch and actors Ray Wise, Grace Zabriskie, and Sheryl Lee is an informal affair that’s of interest primarily for the charisma of the participants, though revealing information emerges. Zabriskie says that other directors frequently ask her about her collaborations with Lynch, and she tells them that Lynch is open to the variables of collaboration, enjoying and using what he sees each day on the set, rather than imposing a pre-calculated vision. This account is complemented by a new interview with Badalamenti, who discusses, with refreshing specificity, how Lynch directs his composing. Lynch is open to various ideas, trusting his instincts to guide him toward the heart of any given film, and many of Fire Walk with Me‘s most memorable musical riffs were fashioned nearly on a whim. The new interview with Lee isn’t as detailed, partially because she’s understandably uncomfortable discussing the film’s most intense and intimate scenes, but she offers a moving glimpse of the challenges of keeping oneself emotionally open as an actor. Lee remembers being in a store after the filming of Twin Peaks had wrapped and feeling as if she could have her own thoughts again, rather than those of the doomed Laura. Rounding out the package is an excerpt from Chris Rodley’s interview book, Lynch on Lynch.\n",

      "\n",
      "If there’s one thing everyone who thinks of themselves as reasonable and well-informed knows, tidal power is the thing. How do they know this? Well, because they’re aware that wind and solar power have their flaws but their hearts tell them that renewable energy must be a good thing because it’s clean and it’s free so therefore they’ve decided to pin their hopes on the technology whose crapness hasn’t been tested yet – and that means tidal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also they’ll have read thinly-disguised press releases like this article First full-scale tidal generator in Wales unveiled: Deltastream array to power 10,000 homes using ebb and flow of the ocean and gone: “Well they wouldn’t print stuff like that unless it were true, would they?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, surprise surprise, this tidal project – subsidised to the tune of £8 million by the European Union, with another £500,000 from the Welsh government – is lying in ruins on the Pembrokeshire sea bed because the company that ran it – Tidal Energy Ltd – has gone into administration. It failed after just three months of operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a problem all too familiar with so many projects in the renewable energy sector: see also Solyndra and Abengoa, for example. Because the unreliable, expensive power they produce is not commercially viable, they fold as soon as the government subsidies dry up. But we’re not supposed to mind about public money being squandered in this way because, hey, it’s green and the intentions were good.\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2012, in order to boost renewable energy usage the Northern Irish government hit on the brilliant scheme of subsidising businesses to the tune of a £160 rebate for every £100 they spent on fuels, such as wood pellets, burnt in biomass boilers. Naturally, every business with any sense piled in to grab a piece of this free money.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Times(£) reports, this had unintended consequences:\n",
      "\n",
      "Flaws in the scheme were exposed by a whistleblower who said businesses were buying biomass boilers solely to collect the subsidy. The whistleblower alleged that one farmer expected to make £1 million over 20 years for using a biomass boiler to heat an empty shed, while heating a number of empty factories would net their owner £1.5 million. Northern Ireland’s auditor-general, Kieran Donnelly, says the RHI had “serious systemic weaknesses from the start” because it did not have the built-in spending controls imposed on a similar scheme in Great Britain. He added that the scheme was vulnerable to abuse and possible fraud.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anaerobic digesters are machines that turn crops into fuel, by converting agricultural waste into methane which is fed into the national gas grid. This is a very expensive way of producing energy – and just the sort of thing Jonathan Swift was satirising three centuries ago when his Academy of Laputa in Gulliver’s Travels devised schemes to extract sunbeams from cucumbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the anaerobic digester case, a gullible British government – the useless Cameron/Clegg Coalition to be specific – actually decided that sunbeams from cucumbers was such a good idea that they’d massively subsidise it through the Renewable Heat Incentive. Naturally, like cockroaches to a rotting carcass, the usual rent-seekers – among them wind turbine developer Dale “Dog On A Rope” Vince have piled in to take advantage of all that free money.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as David Rose has reported, the Anaerobic Digester business is yet another dodgy eco scam. First there’s not enough agricultural waste to fuel these machines, so instead crops – such as eco-unfriendly maize – are being grown specifically to provide fuel them. A government report has described this as “not a cost-effective means of biomethane production.” No, indeed. Methane gas produced in this way costs three-and-half times as much as that from fossil fuel sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of this, these AD industrial plants can be highly polluting – both in the form of increased traffic (just one project by Dale Vince’s Ecotricity will involve 12,792 extra “vehicle movements” per year in a hitherto tranquil rural area) and in the form of leaks, like the one that contaminated 70 acres of this farmer’s land. Oh, and it can also cause explosions like the one that blew up a containment tank at Harper Adams agricultural college two years ago.\n",

      "Seven families from Banteer, N. Cork in Ireland are set to win a multi-million Euro landmark court ruling in an out-of-court settlement in a long-running case against a German wind turbine manufacturer. They sued because of the damage done to their health by the infrasound and low frequency noise produced by the wind turbines sited near their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This scandal has been simmering for years. I have been reporting since 2012 on the damage to human and animal health caused by wind turbines. But the renewables industry – worth an annual $300 billion – has many powerful vested interests and has persistently sought to cover its tracks with threatening legal letters, gagging clauses, and lavishly funded propaganda by industry trade bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s significant about this Irish case is that it now sets a global precedent for further legal action around the world. If I were an investor, I seriously wouldn’t want to be exposed to the wind industry right now: it could face class actions as heavy as the one against Big Tobacco. Although I have no control over the investment strategy of my hedge fund CoolFutures, one of the things I hope it will be doing is shorting wind turbine shares.\n",

      "\n",
      "The area involved is at least 600 square miles of the Radnor Hills from the Brecon Beacons all the way to the Shropshire Border. This is planning on a massive scale. The previous round of wind generations proposals was widely debated and resulted in the so called TAN 8 allocations in areas deemed to be of minimum environmental impact. These new proposals are for an area fifteen times larger, with no Environmental Impact Assessment. What is being proposed is the expansion of the alternative energy target for our area from 50 megawatts to 600 megawatts. This is an eye-watering hike. The deployment of wind-power on this scale in to the national grid will necessitate the construction of huge windmills (the size of the London Eye) and the installation of ranks of pylons to take their output in to the grid system. This Grid presently goes from Gloucester to Shrewsbury and then in to Newtown, and from Gloucester to Cardiff. Pylons would have to march up our valleys into all our hills in the designated areas. Access Roads spurring off trunk systems would have to be built up to each windmill, and the depth of concrete footings under each mill (more than 50 feet) would have long term effects on water tables. So the visual effect of the windmills themselves are the least of our worries!\n",

      "\n",
      "In the decade or so that I have been covering the Great Green Climate Scam I have often been ridiculed and marginalised by colleagues in the mainstream media as a tin-hat conspiracy theorist. Speaking out against the excesses of the environmental movement has damaged my career, it has damaged my health, it has caused massive upset to my family and it has taken me down an alley where the story has begun to seem so boring and repetitive that every day feels like groundhog day.\n",

      "But I don’t have the slightest regret about any of this because – like all the dedicated souls, journalists, bloggers, scientists and think tankers who have suffered similarly in this cause – I have done my small bit in a war worth fighting. Pretty soon, now, we are all going to be totally vindicated when Donald Trump assumes office and starts the chain of events which will make it almost impossible for the green boondoggle to continue.\n",

      "In the mainstream media, for example, there remain still only a handful of publications prepared to express scepticism about the global warming scare. Our schools and universities are almost completely ideologically warmist.\n",
      "\n",
      "So too are many institutions – corporations, law firms, trade bodies. So too are the vast majority of churches, of all denominations. So too is almost all local government. So too are significant number of politicians, not just left-wing and green ones, but ones who profess to be conservatives and really ought to know better.\n",

A.P. suggested he had Sarah Palin and right-wing talk show hosts like Glenn Beck in mind as \"the culprits.\"Of course the widely disseminated, right wing propaganda about death panels that were so widely accepted by low-information, fear-driven and easily angered citizens-- especially those predisposed towards paranoia and racist-- and yes, we just described the teabaggers-- wasn't the only meme Fox, Hate Talk Radio and the GOP got out there to their noisy shock troops as they pushed divisiveness to a societal breaking point. Another was how Barney Frank and ACORN and Obama and the Democrats caused the housing crisis by enticing poor people (read: people of color) into buying homes-- as if Ronald Reagan and George Bush weren't trumpeting the same theme and as if the predator banksters/GOP donors were just innocent bystanders in the whole socialistic mess!Today'sbreaks the news that any honest realtor could have told you long ago: the biggest defaulters on mortgages are the rich , making strategic business decisions to walk away from investments gone bad: \"[n]o need for tears, but the well-off are losing their master suites and saying goodbye to their wine cellars... More than one in seven homeowners with loans in excess of a million dollars are seriously delinquent [and] by contrast, homeowners with less lavish housing are much more likely to keep writing checks to their lender. About one in 12 mortgages below the million-dollar mark is delinquent... 'The rich are different: they are more ruthless,' said Sam Khater, CoreLogic’s senior economist.\" Laughably, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Darrell Issa, Sean Hannity and other Republican clowns have tried to lay the blame for the housing problem on both working families and on progressives and no one more than on Barney Frank. It's become as much a truism among right-wing dim bulbs that Barney caused the housing bubble as it is that Obama is a fascist socialist Muslim born in Kenya or Indonesia. We caught up with Barney a few minutes ago at an airport on the way back to Boston. He had read thepiece. \"We've had,\" he began, \"the worst economic situation since the Great Depression and it was caused by the right wing's commitment tonon-regulation. And as to their blaming, the Republicans controlled both Houses of Congress from 1995 'til 2006. I deny responsibility personally for the decisions of Newt Gingrich, Tom DeLay and Dick Armey. And I can prove that Tom DeLay does not take advise from me... because if he did, I would have told him not to go one that dance show.\"Tomorrow the newest Blue America endorsed candidate, Fred Johnson (D-MI) will be joining us for a live chat at Crooks and Liars. This morning he told me that thereport is \"typical of the mindset. When it was working class folks who were underwater on their mortgages it was all about 'duty' and 'keeping your word' and everyone was supposed to just suck it up and keep paying their mortgages for the good of society. Now it hits the wealthy and suddenly a house is just a bad investment that they can simply walk away from. How about they start pulling on their own bootstraps for a change, instead of preaching to the rest of us? Of course, many of these folks got where they are through the very types of financial gimmickry that put the economy in the mess it's in now, so I guess it just shows that you reap what you sow.\"Doug Tudor, the Blue America-endorsed candidate for the open seat in Hillsborough and Polk counties in Florida told us he had a similar perspective and took it right into the realm of everyday political decisions citizens have to make. “These people,\" he told me this morning, \"have absolutely no shame, and they also have absolutely no love of country. This is just another example of the rich, and their Conservative career-politician apologists, taking advantage of the system at the overall expense of the American people, while further dragging our economy down with their wanton greed. The working-class people of FL-12 need to know their Representative in Congress will vote on their behalf to stop the rich from gaming a system to the detriment of middle-class America. Along with more robust financial reform legislation, we must also enact Campaign Finance Reform with teeth, so career politicians like Lori Edwards and Dennis Ross can’t use corporate lobbyist money to buy their way into the People’s House.”Just about one year ago BlueNC , in its coverage of the mortgage meltdown, noted how local Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, who, except for her lack of influence, could well have been presumed to have been another divisive Republican fear and smear monger Inglis was referring to, couldn't wait to blame the victims for the collapse of Wall Street's mortgage gambling schemes. \"As I sat and listened to the debate on H.R. 1106 on Thursday,\" wrote Betsy Muse, \"I could not believe my ears. North Carolina Rep. Virginia Foxx blamed the mortgage crisis on the welfare mentality of dishonest borrowers who never intended to pay the money back. I have never been so ashamed of something that I personally did not say or do. It was disheartening to hear such bigotry come from a North Carolina representative to congress. Fortunately, Rep. Alcee Hastings of Florida set Foxx straight.\" This is what the Republican Party is all about and why it is so crucial-- no matter how imperfect the Democrats are-- to keep them from regaining power:\n",

      "Side note: I don't think \"groveling\" means what Donald Trump thinks it means, but forest/trees. The President of the United States concluded the segment with this:\n",

      "TRUMP: I will say this: of those votes cast, none of them come to me. They would all be for the other side. None of them come to me. But when you look at the people that are registered, dead, illegal, and two states, and some cases maybe three states? We have a lot to look into.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's easy to laugh at this, both because you appreciate farce and because you need to do something to mask the pain, but there's an insidious sleight of hand here. It is true that there are dead people who are registered to vote, since most people forget to notify their county elections board of their death. It is also true that there are people—like Steve Bannon, Steven Mnuchin, and the president's own daughter—who, because they have lived in more than one state of late, still appear on more than one voter roll. To be clear, neither one of these true statements has any effect on the integrity of election outcomes, but they're at least...true. When it comes to this president, that's borderline cause for celebration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with these two truths, though, President Trump throws in one outlandish, demonstrably false lie: that there are undocumented immigrants who illegally vote. This tinfoil hat fodder has been debunked by just about everyone you can imagine, but by sandwiching his lie between two truths to make it appear less egregious, he signals to Republican-controlled state governments that they have carte blanche to engage in voter suppression efforts, so long as they give it some septic, administrative-sounding label like \"tidying up,\" \"cleaning house,\" or \"updating the voting rolls.\" Guess which registrations mysteriously and disproportionately disappear during exercises like these? Click if you want, but be honest: You already know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing President Trump's democracy-destroying hijinks du jour has already become an exhausting exercise, because the man is committing his crimes against reality so quickly that there's scarcely time to dissect the horrifying implications of one before another comes along, short-circuits the alarm cycle, and starts it all over again. He is walking chaos theory: if he just keeps the hits coming fast enough, the very real danger is that the collective national outrage will first give way to apathy, and then to resignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way for Americans to fight these feelings of helplessness and hopelessness is to search out new, creative ways to channel their entirely justified fury toward some good, productive use. Midterm elections are less than two years away, but between now and then, President Trump has made it very clear that some bullshit of epic proportions is coming down the pike, so start with this: go make damn sure you're registered to vote.\n",

      "The Felix Paradox, in short, is the name given to the effect(s) seen after a major police operation (a large drug bust, etc.) results in a rise in crime rate instead of an expected decrease in criminal activity. The name originated after California law enforcement busted drug kingpin Felix Mitchell.\n",

      "Mitchell’s funeral was covered by national news media who broadcasted images of the thousands of people lining the streets of Oakland, waiting for a glimpse of the horse-drawn carriage carrying the drug dealer’s body. The carriage was followed by a long, long line of Rolls Royce limo’s. It was a pretty elaborate affair for someone who could probably be credited for fueling the crack cocaine epidemic in the U.S.\n",

      "By the way, a criminal’s funeral is a great place to fish for wanted suspects who turn out to show their support for their fallen comrades in crime. And that’s exactly what we saw last night. Even Shaquille O’Neal, one of Coop’s old buddies from “back in the day” showed up, hoping to snag a wanted thug or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real story last night, though, was the danger within the ranks. And there were plenty of landmines to duck and dodge.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll start by mentioning Ben, whom we saw at the tail-end of a “sleepover” with girlfriend #2, the sister of the bad guy. Then, he has an argument with Brooke that resulted in their breakup. Brooke, however, doesn’t let him off the hook that easily. In fact, Brooke quickly let Ben know that she intends to inflict a great deal of physical harm to him should he choose to stick to his decision about a breakup. I believe the delicate little flower’s lady-like words were something to effect of, “I’ll f*** you up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Ben’s troubles go far deeper than girlfriend woes and a craving for a little side dish of danger to whet his sexual appetite. He’s worried that Sammy’s good-guy conscious will cause him to lose his job as a cop if IA investigators discover he lied to protect Sammy. Well, coming clean about a lie would certainly be easier to stomach than what he did last night, which was nothing short of criminal conspiracy…an honest-to-goodness felony of whopping proportions. Not only could this cause the loss of his job, it could also earn him his own private room at the state penitentiary. I also fear that we’ve seen the beginnings of Ben McKenzie’s exit from the show. I saw several walls last night and there was handwriting on more than one of the surfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sammy, on the other hand, is miserable. He’s in the clear with IA and it looks as if his custody battle has been won. However, he’s a basically a good guy and he’s basically a good cop, and he’s having a difficult time with the fact that he told a lie to the IA investigators. And, I believe the only thing preventing him from coming clean is that Ben’s involved and Sammy doesn’t want to betray his friend and fellow police officer. I wonder how this will all play out in the next two episodes. I’m betting that Sammy spills the beans, paving the way for McKenzie to devote his time to the new show. Of course, at least half of the cast seems to have other offers on the table, so I’m figuring we’ll see a few more paths paved, and soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shawn Hatosy’s nose-to-nose scene where he backs down two-ton Strokeface was priceless. It also shows exactly what officers face on a daily basis. More often than not, police officers are outnumbered, and they often face insurmountable odds. Crooks are heavily armed these days and they’re not afraid to shoot a cop. Therefore, exhibiting a command presence is often the best means of talking your way out of a sticky situation. Sometimes, just showing that you mean business is enough, and Sammy certainly showed Strokeface who had the larger set of…well, you know what I mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did see one problem with Sammy’s confrontation with Strokeface. And it was one that could definitely cost an officer his life. Sammy had Strokeface turn toward the police car and place his hands behind his back. Well, Sammy searched Strokeface before cuffing him. This was a bad move for a couple of reasons. One, when Sammy leaned over to check the pants leg he was off balance and unable to watch the suspect’s upper body. Also, just the sheer size of that guy should make the arresting officer want to get the cuffs on as quickly as possible, especially since Sammy and Ben were outnumbered. So, cuff first, then pat down. We saw Cooper do this correctly later in the show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, the discovery of the drugs and gun’s in the little girl’s house…it was indeed a legal entry. They had no idea if something had happened to her parents or guardian, since they’d found her wandering the streets alone. So to enter the home looking for adults and the possibility that someone had been injured, sick, or worse, would be considered exigent circumstances…an emergency. Sure, once they discovered the stash they should back out and obtain the proper paperwork (search warrant, etc.). The entry, though, was definitely legal.\n",
      "\n",
      "– Lydia and Ruben work the murder of the sergeant’s son. This is a tough pill to swallow for any cop. Without going into detail, I’ll say that I once had the unpleasant job of telling a fellow officer about the suicide attempt of his wife. And, I was nearby when she pulled the trigger of her husband’s service weapon, close enough, in fact, to hear the gunshot. Thanks to the speedy response of EMS and some pretty quick first aid until they arrived, she didn’t die that time. Sadly, after two or three more attempts she finally succeeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, working a case involving someone you know personally can be pretty darn emotional. We saw that last night with Lydia and Ruben, when words were said that were probably best left unsaid. But things happen. Cops are human and they have human emotions that shouldn’t be kept bottled up. Unfortunately, many officers do conceal their feelings until they sometimes boil over. But, cops are a tough breed, and they understand what their peers are going through. Hurt feelings don’t usually last too long in a cop’s world. However, I can’t help thinking about the level of animosity that will develop between Ben and Sammy. Theirs is nothing like the little tiff between Lydia and Ruben.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, Lydia’s a bulldog. She keeps digging until she works out all the angles, and she always seems to make us feel as if she’s doing the right thing, even when it’s not.\n",
      "\n",
      "– The scene where Coop and crew team up with ATF to raid a drug dealer’s house was pretty darn realistic, from the yelling of, “Police, search warrant!” to the break and rake technique of shattering windows and clearing away glass to provide both a distraction from the team’s true point of entry, and to allow outside officers to cover any suspects in the various rooms of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think I could come up with an accurate count of the number of search warrants I’ve served over the years. What I do know is that each one is different and officers never know what to expect on the other side of the door. It’s extremely dangerous, and it’s certainly not a job for the faint of heart. This was a great scene that really took me back to “the day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier I mentioned Cooper properly handcuffing and searching a suspect. This occurred as he and Hank caught up to a wanted suspect at the cemetery. The two officers approached strategically, followed by Cooper ordering the man to his knees. The man obeyed the command and placed his hands behind his head, interlocking his fingers. Coop was right, the guy knew the drill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cooper approached the man while Hank covered him. Cooper used one hand to grasp the man’s interlocked fingers. He used the other to retrieve his handcuffs and applied one cuff to the left wrist. Copper then brought that hand down to the small of the thug’s back. At the same time he used his other hand to bring down the crook’s other hand where he clicked the other cuff in place. THEN, after the bad guy was secure, Coop went about the task of patting the man down, checking for weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "So where are we headed on this journey with LA’s finest TV cops? Have we seen the beginning of the end? It sure looks as if the process of dotting the i’s and the crossing of t’s is in full swing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ben has evolved into someone who’s no better than some of the scum he’s arresting. Sammy’s on the edge of ending his career by coming clean about the lies he told IA investigators. He’s also coming unglued at the seems, thanks to Ben orchestrating a B&E at Sammy’s house. An incident that resulted in a serious assault on Nate’s babysitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia meets her old partner in a restaurant. A partner in more ways than one, I believe. This scene had a Soprano’s feel to it, like we were about to witness a permanent fade to black.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hank is a lonely man who lives with his family, only in his mind. The reality is, he’s a very lonely loner, like many cops who are almost ready for that drive down the long dirt road that ends with the kiss of a gun barrel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cooper. What can I say here other than he’s a survivor who wants to leave this world better than it was when he arrived. And I don’t doubt that he will. Not for a minute. He’s a take charge guy who knows the ropes so well that the entire squad depends on him. They also look up to him as a role model. They see in him the cop they’d like to be. So, if the show makes it to a 6th season, it wouldn’t surprise me to see Cooper sporting another stripe. That would certainly be the way someone like him should enter retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I really appreciate about all the actors on this show is how well they carry themselves. It can be pretty easy to lose track, even if it’s just for a moment, that Coop and crew are actors, not police officers. They each wear the gun, badge, and uniform like they’ve been doing this sort of thing all there lives. They actually walk the walk and talk the talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, these actors are stellar, and I truly appreciate the hard work they put into bringing the lives of police officers into living rooms all over the world. This is how it’s done, folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last thing…I’ve had the pleasure of chatting with a few of the Southland actors over the years, and it always amazes me to hear how much they adore their fans. And the spark and excitement I saw and heard during the first season is still there today. They’re a great group of extremely talented people, from the show’s creator on down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, let’s end the week with a statement from the Southland sergeant. It’s quite appropriate for this day and time, with all the troubles facing today’s law enforcement officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Being a cop doesn’t keep you immune from the s*** of the this world.”\n",

We sincerely apologize for the anger it has caused everyone due to the incident. Sega group is working hard to deliver emotional experience to the players worldwide and deeply regretting about this incident. We will assure that such incident will not happen in the future. Once again, we truly apologize.\n",

      "The original article continues below.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many things to unpack here. First, the word Terajima used is “Chousenjin” (朝鮮人), which literally means “Korean person.” The problem is that the word doesn’t make any difference between North and South Koreans, with the word for North Koreans being “Kita-Chousenjin” (“Kita” means “North”) and the word for South Koreans being “Kankokujin” (“Kankoku” means “South Korea”).\n",

      "Koreans make up a large ethnic group in Japan. Those with permanent residency are either “zainichi Kankokujin” if they are South Korean or “zainichi Chousenjin.” The term “zainichi” (在日) means “Japanese resident.” For example, North Korean schools in Japan are called “Chousenjin Gakkou” (Korean Schools), which are sponsored by North Korea and teach the students pro-North Korean ideology.\n",
      "\n",
      "So although the word “Chousenjin” is used in an official context, the word “Chousenjin” can be considered a slur, especially if it’s directed at all Koreans. For North Koreans in Japan, “zainchi Chousenjin” is the proper term and for South Koreans “Kita-Chousenjin” is correct. The word “Chousenjin” is, on its own, loaded and seen as offensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the comment is more than that. This weekend, North Korea once again fired test missiles. Now might not be the best time for bad missile jokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Terajima made his remark, one of the other actors on stage, Hakuryu, laughed and said, “The hell are you saying.” Born Jun Jung-Il, Hakuryu is second-generation Korean Japanese. He’s made a career out of playing yakuza characters and has known and worked with Terajima for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, as Terajima was making his remark, Nagoshi was saying, “Waiii...Sto...”\n",

An alleged rowdy-sheeter was also part of the group. Liquor and loud music flowed freely in the lounge bar on the 16th floor of UB City , Vittal Mallya Road, well past the forbidden hour.Someone tipped off Cubbon Park police station about the revelry. \"Around 1am, we got a call saying loud music was been played at Skyye bar, and liquor was being served beyond the stipulated time of 11pm. Two constables equipped with a handy cam era were sent to the spot,\" Cubbon Park police said.\"We've directed our staff to videograph all illegal activities that come to their attention, so we have evidence in court,\" a senior officer told TOI.It was around 1.10am when two constables arrived at Skyye. When they began to film the party , Kashappanavar raised hell.\"The legislator asked us what we were doing. We told him they were partying be yond the stipulated hour, so we were recording the illegal activity. We said we were acting on the basis of a complaint. The MLA asked us if we knew who he was,\" the policemen were quoted as telling their higher-ups.\"He snatched our camera. We warned him that he was attacking policemen on duty. He began abusing us, and slapped me on the left side of my chin,\" one of the policemen said.Lawmakers taking the law into their own hands is old hat. Increasingly and worryingly, it is now being targeted at cops, the people who enforce the law on behalf of the executive. In the most recent instance, Congress MLA Vijayanand Kashappanavar slapped a cop for doing his job. Just last week, another MLA, from Bangalore, allegedly slapped a traffic policeman. Such loutish behaviour we once thought belongs to badlands.But MLAs, fuelled by a sense of entitlement, are increasingly breaking the law and preventing the police from functioning. This is highly deplorable. The chief minister should take stern action against law-breaking MLAs.

Days later, social media and commentators are still arguing about whether it was artistically bold or just trashy, and whether it paid homage to African-American culture or exploited it.\n",

      "\n",
      "HOPPER: I'm definitely in the critical category, you could say. I really think that while yes, this performance of Miley's was shocking, it wasn't - to me, perhaps it wasn't shocking in the way that they were hoping that it would be - transgressive and edgy. To me, it was shocking in how it engaged historical racism about, you know, black female sexuality and black women's bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: You write for \"Rookie\" magazine, which is aimed at young women - younger women; and you're also a parent, and so you've got three hats here. You, you know - you're a critic, a mom, you know, in the world of culture and a consumer yourself. OK, so which of those three things do you think is - kind of most informs your opinion about this?\n",
      "\n",
      "HOPPER: Well, my - I'm speaking, you know, purely as a, you know, a feminist culture critic and one who tries to look at performances like these with, you know, an informed perspective, hopefully. My sons are much too young to - you know, what they see on TV is, you know, PBS and \"Sesame Street.\" It's - we're not up to the point where I'm concerned about them seeing Miley shaking it on the VMAs.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: But to that point, though, because, you know, as I think we know, if teenagers, whatever, preteens - what's marketed to preteens - what's marketed to teens, preteens want to see. What's marketed to preteens, younger girls want to see, which is why there are a lot of little kids who are very interested. And if they'd heard that Hannah Montana was going to be on the VMAs, might have been begging their parents to see it. Well, Danielle, what about you? Where are you on this, \"The Black Snob\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "BELTON: Well, there's part of me that, you know, agrees and thinks that, you know, it was in really, really, really, really poor taste. And there's part of me that thinks all of it's extremely silly. She was obviously going for shocking, and it wasn't even titillating. It was very - just vulgar, and kind of crass...\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "BELTON: ...It was poorly choreographed. It was poorly sung. It almost seemed like she was doing a parody of what she thought was what people call ratchet culture, of a very raunchy kind of a strip club-based culture. It felt like she was just making a big scene of all of it with giant teddy bears, and it just - it just was over the top and ludicrous in so many different ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: Well, why do you think it was silly? I want to talk more about why many people particularly think it's racist. And I just want to talk a little bit - 'cause I'm not sure everybody would necessarily understand that - but the silly part of it, just the parody part of it. What do you think is silly?\n",
      "\n",
      "You think the performance was silly, or you think what people are making of it is silly - 'cause this is still a big issue in social media; and also what's interesting is traditional media. A number of traditional, you know, columnists and commentators have been...\n",
      "\n",
      "BELTON: Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: ...Talking about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "BELTON: Well, I - it's a little bit of both 'cause in some respects, this is what the VMAs - this is what they do. They let Britney Spears go on stage shortly after her meltdown and perform, and she was completely out of it. They've let Madonna roll around on the stage and, you know, simulate various things. They have a whole history of trying to set things up to be purposefully shocking. So I'm not going to act surprised that they put on this performance with Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand the people being upset at the cultural appropriation that took place, but it was appropriation of something that I don't particularly care that much for, in the first place. So it's almost like, I'm not going to get all upset and stand up and defend something that comes out of, you know, basically out of stripping. So...\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: OK. Jessica, you said that, you know, as a feminist critic, you also - you kind of surfaced this question of the racist aspect of it. I mean, there have been a number of posts on this. I'm thinking about, you know, Tressie MC. She's actually a scholar who blogs as Tressie MC. But tell about you. Talk to me about this, if you would, 'cause a number of - there have been some feminists who have defended this performance as kind of flipping the script on Robin Thicke because a lot of people have been, you know, talking about this particular song, \"Blurred Lines,\" which is - he performs in the video.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also includes Pharrell Williams and T.I., where these guys - these men are fully clothed and there are, like, four women of different races who are underdressed, let's say, and they're prancing around them in kind of a very suggestive way. And some people say, well, you know what, this is flipping the script because in this case, you know, Miley Cyrus is the provocateur. She's the one being kind of aggressive and that kind of upends the hierarchy there, but other people are saying this is just racist and ratchet. So talk to me about why do people say that?\n",
      "\n",
      "HOPPER: Well, I think there's a few things driving it. You know, it seems like Miley is using and engaging with, you know - as we're calling racquet culture - as a way to transform her image. And that's the point that - Jody Rosen has widely reposted and tweeted a piece on Vulture, where he said, you know, that she's using ratchet culture to reinvent herself and that, historically, white performers have used minstrelsy as a sort of shorts - shortcut to self-actualization, is what he said. And I mean, I definitely see shades of that. Watching this, you know, just in how Miley engaged - you know, at one point she's - has a trio of dancers - the L.A. Bakers, who were also in her video for the same song - and they're dancing behind her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, you know, at a different point she went out and engaged sort of - kind of did a sexual drive-by on the body of Amazon Ashley, who is a 7-foot-tall stripper, burlesque dancer of some renown - and the way that she engaged with it is what a lot of people say - and what I believe too - that the way she engaged with the body, this other woman's body, really reinforced, you know, some, you know, horrible cultural stereotypes about black women.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: Well, she got up close and personal, she made a big point of highlighting her behind. I mean, let's just - people need to know...\n",
      "\n",
      "HOPPER: ...Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: ...What we're talking about. OK, so, I mean, I know we're being very polite about this but the politeness is the opposite of the point of this. I think we have to be honest about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOPPER: She was intimate with that dancer's butt basically. And, you know, some of the critique has - of her - has come from, you know, people who are within that culture, you know, Big Freedia, who is, you know, the name in New Orleans bounce right now, who's been at this for 15 years, you know, there was a widely circulated interview, Big Freedia did on Twitter yesterday about how, you know, Miley couldn't even get the dance right and that was, like, the most embarrassing part, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she doesn't - you know, Big Freedia's sort of contention was that wasn't even really twerking. And, you know, then other people just sort of being mortified at the whole thing and, you know, there's even theories that this was just sort of large-scale performance art. And, you know, I had...\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: ...Well, it was a performance but was it art? It was a performance. But was it art?\n",
      "\n",
      "HOPPER: It was performance, the art, you know, is really in the eye of the beholder. Last night on Twitter, I got into it with Diane Martel, who is the director of both Miley's video and the VMA staging and that came out of her video and \"Blurred Lines\" and said, you know, that they were just trying to be playful and that the whole thing was basically this big play on, you know, teen-selfie culture - you know, with her tongue out and posing and, like, being, you know, really provocative and sexy. And that she never thought about any of the aspects of race. And, you know, to me...\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: ...Well, isn't that interesting, she never thought about it? Well, Danielle what about that? Let me just give Danielle the chance to get back in this conversation. I mean, on a number of levels - I mean, first of all, I don't know that everybody realizes that all of those background dancers were African-American. In her video it's multiracial. On here - and one of the posters on Clutch magazine said that - why is it that when someone wants to be offensive that they link that to black culture. So do you think it was minstrelsy?\n",
      "\n",
      "BELTON: Oh, most definitely. It was, most definitely. Miley Cyrus has been on a path for like the past year where she's been hanging out with Juicy J. She's hanging out with Snoop Dogg. She's hanging out with rappers. She's showing up at concerts and doing her very poor form of twerking at these concerts. This has been a precession that has led up to this finely crass vulgar moment that she had at the VMAs.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: But do we care?\n",

      "BELTON: I personally - I don't care. I did find it tasteless and disgusting but I don't care enough to get upset about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: Jessica, do you care?\n",
      "\n",
      "HOPPER: I mean, big picture, I don't care about Miley Cyrus musically or otherwise, but the thing I do care about and that I engage with as a critic is, you know, that pop music is as descriptive as it is prescriptive towards culture. And that's - you know, that's part of the reason that we love it and, you know, of course it's interesting to get in there and pick it apart. And, you know, there's a - you could put a thesis, you know, as thick as a phonebook in here.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN: OK, we have to leave it there for now. As unfortunately we don't have time for that phonebook but I'm sure we'll be talking about this again.

      "On Monday, Harf was the subject of criticism after she claimed that the only real way to neutralize the danger posed by a messianic death cult that threatens to erode the foundations of Westphalian sovereignty is to provide them all with good paying jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allahpundit pondered whether Harf was articulating administration policy that is aimed at absolving the White House of fault when they inevitably fail to address the ISIS threat comprehensively:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once you identify a root cause in an enemy with whom you’re at war, you’re expected to do something about it to erode their support. If the root cause is Middle Eastern unemployment and economic stagnation, well, that’s something the U.S. government can address, at least at the margins.” he theorized. “If the root cause is Islamic doctrine and identity, from which Salafists take their inspiration and for which they hope to establish a durable caliphate, there ain’t much the United States can do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s possible, but there is no great Marshall Plan-in-waiting for Syria and Iraq. Surely, the administration would love to berate Republicans who fail to appropriate funds for roads and bridges in Mosul and Raqqa in the same away that they have for Mobile and Raleigh, but the president has not proposed a massive post-war reconstruction project for the region. The reason for that is simple: Obama does not expect to see the post-war period as president. This fight is being slow-walked, and Obama has committed to bequeathing to his successor the ISIS threat that he helped incubate though neglect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, Harf sought to put out a few fires on Tuesday and, as any competent and capable spokesperson would, she only made her situation worse (hat tip to Real Clear Politics):\n",
      "\n",
      "When Wolf Blitzer observed that the poverty-breeds-terrorism theory is hopelessly flawed and that high-profile attackers like Osama bin Laden and Mohamed Atta were relatively comfortable and privileged, Harf declined to acknowledge his point. Though she issued an emphatic “absolutely” so as to convey that she was, in fact, listening to Blitzer and understood the words that were coming out of his mouth, she instead plunged into a pre-canned attempt at damage control as her response:\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we looked around the world and say long-term we cannot kill every terrorist around the world nor should we try, how do you get at the root causes of this?” she asked. “Look, it might be too nuanced of an argument for some like I’ve seen over the past 24 hours some of the commentary out but it’s really the smart way for Democrats, for Republicans, military commanders, our partners in the Arab world think we need to combat it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s really no other way to interpret that. If you don’t think that statements like “we can’t kill our way out of this war” and asserting that ISIS militants “lack opportunity for jobs” oversimplifies the crisis in the Middle East, Harf does not believe that you are her intellectual equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harf’s comments reflect the left’s odd preoccupation to ascribe more value to the post-war reconstruction aid that the United States has traditionally provided both vanquished and occupied peoples than they do to the victory in the actual war. It should go without saying that there is no post-war reconstruction period without a thorough and unambiguous victory over the adversary in warfare. First comes capitulation and subjugation, and only then can there be a cultural reformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many on the left seem, consciously or otherwise, married to the notion that you can win a war by airdropping bales of money over hostile targets. It’s a lovely fantasy, and there is nothing “nuanced” about it. In fact, it’s a rather unsophisticated concept. Those who think that an enemy needs to be defeated before they can be converted are not missing Harf’s infinitely complex point. That she would flatter herself into believing that she had spoken over the nation’s heads reflects the hubris that explains her insultingly naïve belief that this abhorrent ideology can only be defeated by an army of career counselors.\n",

Bartolo Gelsomino then allegedly attempted to make it appear as if his 71-year-old wife was stabbed during a burglary, reports the Miami Herald.

I think its ultimate success lies in its total disinterest in self-pity, white guilt, and slavery torture porn.

      "By the time Firaxis had pumped out Civ 4's second expansion, Beyond the Sword, the legendary history-builder was as tight, wide-ranging and complex as it had ever been. No small world wonder, then, that when a trendy, slim-line Civilization 5 scooted in on a pair of wheelies and did a 'Fonzie-point' with thumb and forefinger towards newer players some Civ acolytes elected to stay behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many, systems like Religion and Espionage had become part of the bedrock, as integral to Civ as the desire to crush those bastard Romans. It was seemingly impossible for some to go without the complexity, hexagons or no. With Gods and Kings, then, Firaxis aims to let Civ 5 emit enough cultural significance to retake the allegiance of the players who currently sit beyond its borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "First on the agenda, then, is the reintroduction of religion. Could this be the point that we can answer the enduring question of 'Which religion is best?' without resorting to the 'Well, my one, obviously' default?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want that question weighing on my shoulders!\" laughs Lead Designer Ed Beach. \"It's better to put it on the players. They have to wade through all the beliefs that we're giving them, and try to decide what they need. Say they've got an aggressive leader like Genghis Khan or Napoleon next to them. Do they want to worship a goddess of protection? Or are they in an isolated island kingdom, would it be wise to worship the God of the Sea for bountiful harvests? You look at your situation, you look at what Civilizations you're playing and which victory style you're going for - if you then build all that into your religion then you're good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Warring religions and cunning spies. Can't we all just get along?\n",
      "\n",
      "Civilization 4's religion was a good system in terms of its spread and the allegiances it formed, but there was little player agency. Apropos of nothing you'd hear word that the Romans had discovered Buddhism, and you'd later see them running around sticking swords into Mayan followers of Judaism. It added flavour to the game, but also could feel like something of a random factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new system is based on Faith - a value you earn at first through discovering ancient ruins, constructing holy buildings or pandering to the eccentricities of your chosen Civ. Pictish warriors, for example earn Faith through victory in combat - while the whimsical Celts see their faithometer rise through proximity to the faerie-folk of the forests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once your Faith reservoir is full enough, you'll then create the Pantheon of the Gods - which is your first opportunity to officially establish your religion, and indeed lock it off from opposing Civilizations. Although it'll likely revolve around the terrain you started your game within every city you later found will bear its mark - and in turn start riling the local infidels left, right and centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real fun begins, however, when your Faith flow earns you a Great Prophet. They'll let you customise your religion to keep it more in keeping with contemporary times (no mention of a gay marriage toggle as yet) and to help propel your way of thinking further across the globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a city has a majority of religious types within its walls then they can stare accusingly across a whole ten tiles, draining the willpower of neighbouring heathens.

      "\n",
      "Next up for a heavy update, and also drawn a little closer to the way history has handled the subject matter, are spy games. \"Espionage is giving you a deeper look into the game world, and telling you a lot more about what's going on with the other Civilizations.\" Explains Beach, before launching into a system that provides for far more than a giggling character dashing away from the Aztec capital with Nationalism clasped under his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, espionage now operates from its own separate screen - from which you can act all 'M' and ask your spies stuff like 'How much do you know about the Great Wall of China?' This is your window to goings-on elsewhere in the world, looking in on the rival Civ movements that could formerly only be guessed at when you saw enemy triremes flitting around the furthest reaches of your map. Your embedded spies leech information from your chosen target's AI machinations, letting you see glimpses of who's sending troops where and what's been left unguarded. It's an enticing system, if one that's understandably been snipped from multiplayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The espionage system also lets you toy with city states, letting you rig elections and organise coups. Success will result in a power that suddenly thinks you're the bee's knees, failure will result in the consensus being that you're a gerrymandering git.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to do the decent thing and befriend a city state, meanwhile, then it'll take a lot more than the cold hard cash that was generally required in Civ 5. Depending on their outlook (city states can now be religious or mercantile, as well as their usual vanilla flavour) each will have a checklist of tasks they'd like you to perform. They're more fussy about choosing a mate now, essentially, so you'll have to work hard to charm them. Or, if you think it easier, you can still just send the tanks in...\n",

Dido of the Carthaginians, Pacal the Great of the Mayans, Boudicca of the Celts and William of Orange of the Dutch will all make their presence felt - the latter with a full range of dykes, windmills and tulip fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hot on the tweak-list too, is combat. The primary change here is that Firaxis has slowed down warring to allow for a little more texture and tactical thought. While units duke it out you'll have extra time reshuffle the ranks, draw in reinforcements and draw up your line - so confrontations that whistled past in Civ 5 will now be more dramatic affairs. The unit roster, meanwhile, has been widened to include mechanical starlets from World War One. Naval combat, too, has been given teeth beyond ranged bombardment through bitey melee ships that can knock holes in enemy armadas, and even capture coastal cities under their own steam and sail.\n",

      "...The trouble with this approach is that the IRS allows IP PIN recipients to retrieve their PIN via the agency’s Web site, after supplying the answers to four easy-to-guess questions from consumer credit bureau Equifax. These so-called knowledge-based authentication (KBA) or “out-of-wallet” questions focus on things such as previous address, loan amounts and dates and can be successfully enumerated with random guessing. In many cases, the answers can be found by consulting free online services, such as Zillow and Facebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Becky Wittrock, a certified public accountant (CPA) from Sioux Falls, S.D., said she received an IP PIN in 2014 after crooks tried to impersonate her to the IRS. Wittrock said she found out her IP PIN had been compromised by thieves this year after she tried to file her tax return on Feb. 25, 2016. Turns out, the crooks beat her to the punch by more than three weeks, filing a large refund request with the IRS on Feb. 2, 2016. “So, last year I was devastated by this,” Wittrock said, “But this year I’m just pissed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, the personal records of 100,000 taxpayers wound up in the hands of criminals, thanks to a flimsy authentication process in the agency's \"Get Transcript\" application. In short, the IRS used all-too-common static identifiers to verify taxpayer identity (information that could be found anywhere), allowing criminals to use the system to then obtain notably more sensitive taxpayer information and ultimately steal finances. At the time, the IRS breathlessly insisted it would be shoring up its security standards, though it failed to really detail how it would accomplish this.Tax return fraud has since become a burgeoning industry unto itself, with crooks consistently gaming IRS systems to fool the IRS into sending your money to a criminal's account, something victims only discover when they find their own, legitimate tax returns rejected. To protect these compromised users, the IRS has employed a system wherein it mails these victims a six-digit \"Identity Protection (IP) PIN.\" That pin has been mailed to some 2.7 million victims, and must be entered into the following year's tax return. But not-too-surprisingly, this pin system is also notably easy to game, relying heavily on commonly available user data So yes, that's an agency already hit several times by fraud and internal scandals providing an identity theft tool -- that can be used to help steal your identity. A CPA by the name of Becky Wittrock, who had fallen victim to identity theft in 2014, notes she's now been a repeat victim after thieves impersonated her, then used the IRS's crappy pin system toAfter spending more time trying to prove her identity to the IRS than the thief apparently did, Wittrock was told that next year the IRS will be ditching the pin system for a murky system that may rely on users' driver's licenses. Granted, we do seem to enjoy gutting IRS funding, staffing, authority and overall resources , only to complain that the agency sucks at doing its job. Still, that's no excuse for not implementing some fundamental authentication common sense. Meanwhile, the IRS's repeated failures are troubling for a government that's intent on viewing itself as the foremost expert in cyber-warfare and security, yet still can't manage to keep wolves out of its own henhouse.\n",

      "David Kravets of Wired has a good (in an infuriating way) write-up of the story of Rahinah Ibrahim (pictured at right), a woman who was placed on the no-fly list because of an FBI agent's clerical error. She spent nine years fighting to make the federal government acknowledge and correct its mistake, finally winning just last week. Reason has covered this case, including the vindictive inclusion of U.S. citizen Raihan Mustafa Kamal, Rahinah Ibrahim's daughter, on the no-fly list to prevent her from testifying in the case. Ultimately, the story is not just a tale of injustice, but an illustration of how dangerous it is to allow government officials to invoke \"national security\" as a cover for their actions. As we now know, in this case, they did so through two administrations simply to avoid being publicly embarrassed by their bureaucratic incompetence.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Kravets writes:\n",
      "\n",
      "After seven years of litigation, two trips to a federal appeals court and $3.8 million worth of lawyer time, the public has finally learned why a wheelchair-bound Stanford University scholar was cuffed, detained and denied a flight from San Francisco to Hawaii: FBI human error. FBI agent Kevin Kelley was investigating Muslims in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2004 when he checked the wrong box on a terrorism form, erroneously placing Rahinah Ibrahim on the no-fly list. What happened next was the real shame. Instead of admitting to the error, high-ranking President Barack Obama administration officials spent years covering it up. Attorney General Eric Holder, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and a litany of other government officials claimed repeatedly that disclosing the reason Ibrahim was detained, or even acknowledging that she’d been placed on a watch list, would cause serious damage to the U.S. national security. Again and again they asserted the so-called “state secrets privilege” to block the 48-year-old woman’s lawsuit, which sought only to clear her name. Holder went so far as to tell the judge presiding over the case that this assertion of the state secrets privilege was fully in keeping with Obama’s much-ballyhooed 2009 executive branch reforms of the privilege, which stated the administration would invoke state secrets sparingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Justice Department nearly got away with its shenanigans, which began under the Bush administration and continued, with no interruption, under Obama. U.S. District Judge William Alsup actually tossed Rahinah Ibrahim's lawsuit out of court at one point, only to have it reinstated at the appeals level and handed back to a judge who now very obviously feels used.\n",
      "\n",
      "How did all this begin? As Alsup details in his February 6 ruling, \"FBI Special Agent Kevin Michael Kelley...misunderstood the directions on the form\" he was filling out with regard to Rahinah Ibrahim \"and erroneously nominated Dr. Ibrahim to the TSA's no-fly list.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Ibrahim found out, at the airport, that she couldn't fly, she raised a legal fuss—and the feds closed ranks and refused to admit error. Justice Department officials representing the U.S. government argued in court that \"summary judgment in its favor was appropriate based on state secrets.\"\n",

      "At long last, the government has conceded that plaintiff poses no threat to air safety or national security and should never have been placed on the no-fly list. She got there by human error within the FBI. This too is conceded. This was no minor human error but an error with palpable impact, leading to the humiliation, cuffing, and incarceration of an innocent and incapacitated air traveler. That it was human error may seem hard to accept — the FBI agent filled out the nomination form in a way exactly opposite from the instructions on the form, a bureaucratic analogy to a surgeon amputating the wrong digit — human error, yes, but of considerable consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years of litigation through two administrations from different political parties, both of which tried to make it all go away by claiming that everything was much too hush-hush to be dealt with by a mere court.

      "The moral philosopher Cornel West, if Barack Obama’s ascent to power was a morality play, would be the voice of conscience. Rahm Emanuel, a cynical product of the Chicago political machine, would be Satan. Emanuel in the first scene of the play would dangle power, privilege, fame and money before Obama. West would warn Obama that the quality of a life is defined by its moral commitment, that his legacy will be determined by his willingness to defy the cruel assault by the corporate state and the financial elite against the poor and working men and women, and that justice must never be sacrificed on the altar of power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps there was never much of a struggle in Obama’s heart. Perhaps West only provided a moral veneer. Perhaps the dark heart of Emanuel was always the dark heart of Obama. Only Obama knows. But we know how the play ends. West is banished like honest Kent in “King Lear.” Emanuel and immoral mediocrities from Lawrence Summers to Timothy Geithner to Robert Gates — think of Goneril and Regan in the Shakespearean tragedy — take power. We lose. And Obama becomes an obedient servant of the corporate elite in exchange for the hollow trappings of authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one grasps this tragic descent better than West, who did 65 campaign events for Obama, believed in the potential for change and was encouraged by the populist rhetoric of the Obama campaign. He now nurses, like many others who placed their faith in Obama, the anguish of the deceived, manipulated and betrayed. He bitterly describes Obama as “a black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs and a black puppet of corporate plutocrats. And now he has become head of the American killing machine and is proud of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you look at a society you look at it through the lens of the least of these, the weak and the vulnerable; you are committed to loving them first, not exclusively, but first, and therefore giving them priority,” says West, the Class of 1943 University Professor of African American Studies and Religion at Princeton University. “And even at this moment, when the empire is in deep decline, the culture is in deep decay, the political system is broken, where nearly everyone is up for sale, you say all I have is the subversive memory of those who came before, personal integrity, trying to live a decent life, and a willingness to live and die for the love of folk who are catching hell. This means civil disobedience, going to jail, supporting progressive forums of social unrest if they in fact awaken the conscience, whatever conscience is left, of the nation. And that’s where I find myself now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have to take some responsibility,” he admits of his support for Obama as we sit in his book-lined office. “I could have been reading into it more than was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was thinking maybe he has at least some progressive populist instincts that could become more manifest after the cautious policies of being a senator and working with [Sen. Joe] Lieberman as his mentor,” he says. “But it became very clear when I looked at the neoliberal economic team. The first announcement of Summers and Geithner I went ballistic. I said, ‘Oh, my God, I have really been misled at a very deep level.’ And the same is true for Dennis Ross and the other neo-imperial elites. I said, ‘I have been thoroughly misled, all this populist language is just a facade. I was under the impression that he might bring in the voices of brother Joseph Stiglitz and brother Paul Krugman. I figured, OK, given the structure of constraints of the capitalist democratic procedure that’s probably the best he could do. But at least he would have some voices concerned about working people, dealing with issues of jobs and downsizing and banks, some semblance of democratic accountability for Wall Street oligarchs and corporate plutocrats who are just running amuck. I was completely wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "West says the betrayal occurred on two levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is the personal level,” he says. “I used to call my dear brother [Obama] every two weeks. I said a prayer on the phone for him, especially before a debate. And I never got a call back. And when I ran into him in the state Capitol in South Carolina when I was down there campaigning for him he was very kind. The first thing he told me was, ‘Brother West, I feel so bad. I haven’t called you back. You been calling me so much. You been giving me so much love, so much support and what have you.’ And I said, ‘I know you’re busy.’ But then a month and half later I would run into other people on the campaign and he’s calling them all the time. I said, wow, this is kind of strange. He doesn’t have time, even two seconds, to say thank you or I’m glad you’re pulling for me and praying for me, but he’s calling these other people. I said, this is very interesting. And then as it turns out with the inauguration I couldn’t get a ticket with my mother and my brother. I said this is very strange. We drive into the hotel and the guy who picks up my bags from the hotel has a ticket to the inauguration. My mom says, ‘That’s something that this dear brother can get a ticket and you can’t get one, honey, all the work you did for him from Iowa.’ Beginning in Iowa to Ohio. We had to watch the thing in the hotel.“What it said to me on a personal level,” he goes on, “was that brother Barack Obama had no sense of gratitude, no sense of loyalty, no sense of even courtesy, [no] sense of decency, just to say thank you. Is this the kind of manipulative, Machiavellian orientation we ought to get used to? That was on a personal level.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was also the betrayal on the political and ideological level.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It became very clear to me as the announcements were being made,” he says, “that this was going to be a newcomer, in many ways like Bill Clinton, who wanted to reassure the Establishment by bringing in persons they felt comfortable with and that we were really going to get someone who was using intermittent progressive populist language in order to justify a centrist, neoliberalist policy that we see in the opportunism of Bill Clinton. It was very much going to be a kind of black face of the DLC [Democratic Leadership Council].”\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama and West’s last personal contact took place a year ago at a gathering of the Urban League when, he says, Obama “cussed me out.” Obama, after his address, which promoted his administration’s championing of charter schools, approached West, who was seated in the front row.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He makes a bee line to me right after the talk, in front of everybody,” West says. “He just lets me have it. He says, ‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself, saying I’m not a progressive. Is that the best you can do? Who do you think you are?’ I smiled. I shook his hand. And a sister hollered in the back, ‘You can’t talk to professor West. That’s Dr. Cornel West. Who do you think you are?’ You can go to jail talking to the president like that. You got to watch yourself. I wanted to slap him on the side of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was so disrespectful,” he went on, “that’s what I didn’t like. I’d already been called, along with all [other] leftists, a “F’ing retard” by Rahm Emanuel because we had critiques of the president.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president, has, West said, phoned him to complain about his critiques of Obama. Jarrett was especially perturbed, West says, when he said in an interview last year that he saw a lot of Malcolm X and Ella Baker in Michelle Obama. Jarrett told him his comments were not complimentary to the first lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said in the world that I live in, in that which authorizes my reality, Ella Baker is a towering figure,” he says, munching Fritos and sipping apple juice at his desk. “If I say there is a lot of Ella Baker in Michelle Obama, that’s a compliment. She can take it any way she wants. I can tell her I’m sorry it offended you, but I’m going to speak the truth. She is a Harvard Law graduate, a Princeton graduate, and she deals with child obesity and military families. Why doesn’t she visit a prison? Why not spend some time in the hood? That is where she is, but she can’t do it.\n",

      "“I think my dear brother Barack Obama has a certain fear of free black men,” West says. “It’s understandable. As a young brother who grows up in a white context, brilliant African father, he’s always had to fear being a white man with black skin. All he has known culturally is white. He is just as human as I am, but that is his cultural formation. When he meets an independent black brother, it is frightening. And that’s true for a white brother. When you get a white brother who meets a free, independent black man, they got to be mature to really embrace fully what the brother is saying to them. It’s a tension, given the history. It can be overcome. Obama, coming out of Kansas influence, white, loving grandparents, coming out of Hawaii and Indonesia, when he meets these independent black folk who have a history of slavery, Jim Crow, Jane Crow and so on, he is very apprehensive. He has a certain rootlessness, a deracination. It is understandable.\n",

      "“He feels most comfortable with upper middle-class white and Jewish men who consider themselves very smart, very savvy and very effective in getting what they want,” he says. “He’s got two homes. He has got his family and whatever challenges go on there, and this other home. Larry Summers blows his mind because he’s so smart. He’s got Establishment connections. He’s embracing me. It is this smartness, this truncated brilliance, that titillates and stimulates brother Barack and makes him feel at home. That is very sad for me.\n",

      "“This was maybe America’s last chance to fight back against the greed of the Wall Street oligarchs and corporate plutocrats, to generate some serious discussion about public interest and common good that sustains any democratic experiment,” West laments. “We are squeezing out all of the democratic juices we have. The escalation of the class war against the poor and the working class is intense. More and more working people are beaten down. They are world-weary. They are into self-medication. They are turning on each other. They are scapegoating the most vulnerable rather than confronting the most powerful. It is a profoundly human response to panic and catastrophe. I thought Barack Obama could have provided some way out. But he lacks backbone.“Can you imagine if Barack Obama had taken office and deliberately educated and taught the American people about the nature of the financial catastrophe and what greed was really taking place?” West asks. “If he had told us what kind of mechanisms of accountability needed to be in place, if he had focused on homeowners rather than investment banks for bailouts and engaged in massive job creation he could have nipped in the bud the right-wing populism of the tea party folk. The tea party folk are right when they say the government is corrupt. It is corrupt. Big business and banks have taken over government and corrupted it in deep ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have got to attempt to tell the truth, and that truth is painful,” he says. “It is a truth that is against the thick lies of the mainstream. In telling that truth we become so maladjusted to the prevailing injustice that the Democratic Party, more and more, is not just milquetoast and spineless, as it was before, but thoroughly complicitous with some of the worst things in the American empire. I don’t think in good conscience I could tell anybody to vote for Obama. If it turns out in the end that we have a crypto-fascist movement and the only thing standing between us and fascism is Barack Obama, then we have to put our foot on the brake. But we’ve got to think seriously of third-party candidates, third formations, third parties.\n",

      "“Our last hope is to generate a democratic awakening among our fellow citizens. This means raising our voices, very loud and strong, bearing witness, individually and collectively. Tavis [Smiley] and I have talked about ways of civil disobedience, beginning with ways for both of us to get arrested, to galvanize attention to the plight of those in prisons, in the hoods, in poor white communities. We must never give up. We must never allow hope to be eliminated or suffocated.”\n",
