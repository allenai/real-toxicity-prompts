      "In an interview with the Tallahassee Democrat, the pair discussed how their newfound high-school royalty is more than a personal win, but also a symbol of hope for other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It feels good to know some of the things we’ve been a part of can help others going through tough experiences, in a positive way,” Grimes said. “I needed someone in my life to show me that it would work out — when I was first going through this years ago. But I didn’t have that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope that people will look at this and more will begin to think that it’s okay to be supportive of the LBTQ community,” Creel added. “Leon often talks about change. ... This is a good example for younger students there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Leon High School has had a gay-straight alliance since 2001, although school administrators initially pushed to call it a “Tolerance Club” for fear it might be targeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the organization’s sponsor, history teacher Scott Brown, the coronation of Creel and Grimes demonstrates the progress of LGBT rights in the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It makes me feel proud to know that the majority of Leon students are open-minded and agree with today’s changing mores,” he said. “Leon may be a traditional school, but we can be known as progressive.”\n",

      "\n",
      "CONTINUATION: \n",
      "The action by the Circuit Court is a temporary solution until a permanent appointment can be voted on in the next session of Virginia’s General Assembly in January 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOP lawmakers in the Virginia House of Delegates, led by virulently anti-gay Del. Bob Marshall (R-Prince William), blocked the judicial nomination of Thorne-Begland, a Richmond prosecutor for the past 12 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conservative group The Family Foundation and Marshall argued that Thorne-Begland’s sexual orientation would conflict with his ability to hold up the state’s constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The appointment Thursday of Thorne-Begland by the Circuit Court judges has infuriated Marshall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it’s highly imprudent and arrogant on their part,” said Marshall. “I hope Virginia understands what’s going on here: They’re contesting the authority of the General Assembly here. … This is an act of defiance on their part. When appointed officials get in fights with elected officials, they invariably lose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "State Sen. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico, Va.), who supported Thorne-Begland’s initial nomination, applauded the circuit court judges “for recognizing Mr. Thorne-Begland’s skill, qualifications and competency, and putting aside bigotry, prejudice and false excuses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have always had and continue to have the utmost confidence in Mr. Thorne-Begland’s ability to serve our community and I am gratified to see that the circuit court judges share my confidence,” McEachin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this week, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that leaders of Richmond’s five largest law firms had urged the city’s Circuit Court judges to appoint Thorne-Begland to the bench, acknowledging however that it would be an interim appointment, lasting only until the General Assembly reconvenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The House of Delgates blocked Thorne-Begland’s appointment in May by a wide margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thorne-Begland received 33 votes, and 31 delegates voted against him. He needed a majority of the 100-member House — 51 votes — to secure the judgeship. Ten delegates abstained and 26 others did not vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thorne-Begland, who lives with his partner and two adopted children, has been an outspoken advocate of LGBT rights, particularly following his discharge from the U.S. Navy in the early 1990s under the now repealed “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy.\n",

      "CONTINUATION: And then she went on to do what she condemned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexual harassment occurs when one person chooses to sexually objectify another person. And in a tweet, DeGeneres shared a photo of herself and singer Katy Perry with DeGeneres’ jaw wide open and gawking directly at Perry's breasts. To complete the hypocritical gesture, DeGeneres included this caption:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The real question now is how would DeGeneres have responded if it were a man who did exactly what she did – taking a photo posing with his jaw wide open and head gawking into the breasts of another woman?\n",
      "\n",
      "How would DeGeneres react if it were a man making the same comments, calling a woman’s breasts “big balloons?” She would no doubt be one of the first people to publicly condemn such an action as being sexist and harassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not a male thing or a female thing, it is not a Hollywood thing or a political thing, this is a human thing and it happens in the workplace, it happens in families, it happens all over the world and we are all the same,” she said on her TV show in a monologue discussing sexual harassment. “We all want the same thing, we want respect, love and kindness. And if I could have those three things and an iPhone X, I would be complete.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So how does DeGeneres justify her sexist action?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it because she's a woman and she thinks that it's okay for one woman to objectify another woman's body?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it because DeGeneres believes that since she is a lesbian she can objectify or make sexual comments about another woman's body?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to be a social justice warrior Ellen, then you must also be the example. You cannot just bandy words around and argue against sexual harassment, calling for love, respect and kindness for all humans when you are actually the one engaging in the very thing you condemn.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is exactly these sorts of behaviors that lead the general public to become so exhausted and disgusted by the hypocrisy of Hollywood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellen, don't use an anti-sexual harassment campaign to build yourself up or to widen your audience or to gain more ratings. Do it because you believe in it. And if you believe in it then maintain your integrity and be consistent in your actions. At the very least, you could own up to your sexist actions, apologize and learn from your own mistakes.\n",
